I enjoy when a potential client asks interesting coding questions as a
qualification. It is a quick and easy way to see if the client enjoys your
style and gives you something to talk about afterwards.

The question is:

Write a model (ActiveRecord-based) for storing global configuration settings.
It will be used for storing single values, for example an email address to send
error emails to, or a flag enable/disable a particular feature. The interface
must be simple and convenient, - it should be possible to read and write
specific configuration items. It must be possible to store values of these 4
types: string, integer, float and boolean. The model should come with a unit
test and a migration.

Bonus: add caching within the model so that values are cached in regular Rails
cache to minimize db load.
